# This repository holds code and data tables from our study "Single-cell new RNA sequencing reveals principles of transcription at the resolution of individual bursts".
This repository contains scripts and tabular data related to a forthcoming manuscript that describes the RNA library preparation method NASC-Seq2 and presents data analysis using such data to study transcriptional burst kinetics and gene cobursting.

The tabular data, meaning count tables and estimated burst kinetics from the study, can be found in folder `data_tables` of this repository.

For script, there are three catogories, corresponding to the sections of the manuscript:

In the folder `data_processing`, you can find scripts and instructions on how to go from NASC-Seq2 sequencing output to molecular counts.

In the folder `kinetics_lookup`, you can find script for generating burst kinetic estimates from molecular counts, and code we used for plots in the manuscript, simulations and format conversions.

In the folder `cobursting`, you can find script that were used for our cobursting analysis.

Some of the folders contain additional readme files for further information.
